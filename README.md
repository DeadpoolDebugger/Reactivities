# REACTIVITIES
**Reactivities** is a sample application designed to book activities, where users can confirm participation or cancel if they choose not to attend.

This project is built using:

- **.NET Core** for the backend

- **ReactJS (v19)** for the frontend

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the **modern approach to application development** using **Clean Architecture** and other best practices that are commonly adopted in enterprise-level projects.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

The complete documentation for this application is provided from scratch, covering the entire process from project setup to the final implementation.

To make it easier to follow, the documentation is divided into two main sections:

- Backend (.NET Core) – covers API, architecture, and business logic

- Frontend (ReactJS) – covers UI, state management, and client-side interactions

This project serves as a comprehensive guide for developers who want to learn how modern applications are structured and developed step by step.
